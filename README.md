# NLP Project: Named Entity Recognition with spaCy

This project demonstrates the use of the `spaCy` library for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks such as tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and named entity recognition (NER). The primary focus is on analyzing garden path sentences, which are sentences that initially seem to have one structure but end up having a different structure.

## Short Description

This project showcases the use of the `spaCy` library for performing Named Entity Recognition (NER) on garden path sentences. It includes tasks such as tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and entity recognition, demonstrating how `spaCy` can be applied to analyze complex and ambiguous sentences. The project processes a list of garden path sentences, providing insights into their linguistic structures and identified entities.

## Installation

To run this project, you'll need to install `spaCy` and download the English language model. Follow these steps:

1. Install `spaCy`:
    ```bash
    pip install spacy
    ```

2. Download the English language model:
    ```bash
    python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
    ```

## Usage

1. Import the required library:
    ```python
    import spacy
    ```

2. Load the English language model:
    ```python
    nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
    ```

3. Define garden path sentences and additional sentences:
    ```python
    gardenpathSentences = [
        "The man whistling tunes pianos beatifully.",
        "The cotton clothing is usually made of grows in Mississippi.",
        "The chicken ready to eat.",
        "The old man the newspaper."
    ]

    additionalSentences = [
        "Marry gave the child a Band_Aid.",
        "That Jill is never here hurts.",
        "The old man the ships."
    ]

    gardenpathSentences.extend(additionalSentences)
    ```

4. Tokenize each sentence and perform NER:
    ```python
    for sentence in gardenpathSentences:
        doc = nlp(sentence)
        print("Sentence:", sentence)
        
        for token in doc:
            print(token.text, token.pos_, spacy.explain(token.pos_))
        
        for ent in doc.ents:
            print(ent.text, ent.label_, spacy.explain(ent.label_))
        
        print("\n")
    ```

## Project Details

- **Tokenization:** The process of breaking down text into smaller units called tokens.
- **Part-of-Speech Tagging:** Identifying the grammatical categories of words.
- **Named Entity Recognition:** Identifying and classifying named entities in text.

## Entities Explained

### Looked-up Entities

1. **GPE (Geopolitical Entity):** 
    - Represents countries, cities, states.
    - Example: "Mississippi" in "The cotton clothing is usually made of grows in Mississippi." makes sense as Mississippi is a state in the USA.

2. **ORG (Organization):**
    - Represents companies, agencies, institutions, etc.
    - Example: "Band_Aid" in "Marry gave the child a Band_Aid." does not make sense as an organization; it is a brand name for adhesive bandages.
